# DID-Box
It is a personal data storage solution, manager and aggregator.

## Key Features:
- The application provides a unified interface for users to store, aggregate, and manage their data (personal, education, health, media  etc) which can then be shared across different platforms such as social media platforms, healthcare providers, financial institutions based on permissions. This eliminates the need for users to navigate multiple platforms and manage separate accounts for each data source. Instead, they can have a single application where they can securely store, organize, and access their data.
